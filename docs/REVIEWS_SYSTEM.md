```

// In your product page component
<ReviewsSection productId={product.id} productSlug={product.slug} />
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Review
```tsx
const reviewService = new ReviewService();
const review = await reviewService.createReview({
  product_id: 'product-uuid',
  rating: 5,
  comment: 'Great product!'
}, user.id);
```

### Getting Product Reviews
```tsx
const reviews = await reviewService.getProductReviews('product-uuid', {
  status: 'approved',
  page: 1,
  limit: 10
});
```

### Moderating a Review
```tsx
// Approve a review
await reviewService.approveReview('review-uuid');

// Reject a review
await reviewService.rejectReview('review-uuid');
```

## Review Workflow

### Customer Journey
1. **Browse Product**: Customer visits product page
2. **Login**: Customer logs in to submit review
3. **Submit Review**: Customer fills review form and submits
4. **Pending Status**: Review is marked as pending
5. **Admin Review**: Admin reviews and moderates
6. **Published**: Approved reviews appear on product page

### Admin Workflow
1. **Review Queue**: Admin checks pending reviews
2. **Review Content**: Admin reads review and checks for violations
3. **Take Action**: Approve, reject, or delete review
4. **Update Status**: Review status is updated accordingly
5. **Monitor**: Admin monitors review quality and user feedback

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- Rating must be 1-5
- Comment length limits (10-1000 characters)
- XSS prevention in comments
- SQL injection prevention

### Access Control
- RLS policies enforce access control
- Users can only manage their own reviews
- Admins have full access to all reviews
- Public can only view approved reviews

### Data Integrity
- Unique constraint prevents duplicate reviews
- Cascade deletion maintains referential integrity
- Automatic timestamp updates
- Status validation

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Indexes
- Product ID index for fast product review queries
- User ID index for user review queries
- Status index for filtering
- Created at index for sorting

### Caching Strategy
- Review statistics cached at product level
- Review lists paginated for performance
- User review cached to avoid repeated queries

### Frontend Optimizations
- Lazy loading of review components
- Pagination to limit initial load
- Debounced search and filtering
- Optimistic updates for better UX

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Reviews Not Appearing**
   - Check review status (must be 'approved')
   - Verify RLS policies
   - Check user permissions

2. **Cannot Submit Review**
   - Ensure user is logged in
   - Check for existing review (one per user per product)
   - Validate form inputs

3. **Admin Cannot Moderate**
   - Verify admin/manager role
   - Check RLS policies
   - Ensure proper authentication

### Debug Steps
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Supabase connection
3. Test RLS policies
4. Check user roles and permissions
5. Validate database constraints
