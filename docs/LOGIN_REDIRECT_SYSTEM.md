# Login Redirect System

## Overview

The login popup has been removed and replaced with a redirect system that takes users to the login page and then redirects them back to where they were before logging in.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated AuthContext (`contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)

**Removed:**
- `isLoginPopupOpen` state
- `openLoginPopup()` function
- `closeLoginPopup()` function

**Added:**
- `requireAuth(redirectTo?: string)` function that:
  - Saves the current URL to localStorage
  - Redirects to `/login` page

### 2. Updated Login Page (`app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`)

**Enhanced:**
- After successful login, retrieves the saved URL from localStorage
- Redirects user back to the original page they were trying to access
- Works with both email/password and OTP login methods

### 3. Updated Redirect Utilities (`utils/redirectUtils.ts`)

**Added functions:**
- `saveRedirectUrl(url?: string)` - Saves current URL for post-login redirect
- `getAndClearRedirectUrl()` - Retrieves and clears saved URL
- `shouldRedirectToLogin(requiredRole?: string)` - Checks if user needs to be redirected

### 4. Updated Checkout Page (`app/(public)/cart/checkout/page.tsx`)

**Changed:**
- Replaced `openLoginPopup` with `requireAuth`
- bKash payment now redirects to login page instead of showing popup
- After login, user returns to checkout page

### 5. Updated Review Form (`components/reviews/ReviewForm.tsx`)

**Changed:**
- Replaced login link with `requireAuth()` call
- Users are redirected to login page and return to product page after login

### 6. Removed Login Popup Component

**Deleted:**
- `components/AuthLoginPopup.tsx` - No longer needed
- Removed from `app/layout.tsx`

### 7. Updated Header Component (`components/layout/Header.tsx`)

**Already using:**
- `router.push('/login')` for sign-in button (no changes needed)

## How It Works

1. **User tries to access protected content** (e.g., bKash payment, review submission)
2. **System saves current URL** to localStorage as `redirectAfterLogin`
3. **User is redirected** to `/login` page
4. **User logs in successfully** (email/password or OTP)
5. **System retrieves saved URL** and redirects user back to original page
6. **User can continue** with their original action

## Benefits

- **Better UX**: Full-page login experience instead of cramped popup
- **Mobile-friendly**: Login page works better on mobile devices
- **Consistent flow**: All authentication follows the same pattern
- **SEO-friendly**: Login page can be indexed and shared
- **Accessibility**: Better screen reader support

## Testing

Visit `/test-redirect` to test the redirect system:
- If not logged in, you'll be redirected to login page
- After login, you'll be redirected back to `/test-redirect`
- The page will show your user information if redirect worked correctly

## Usage Examples

### Protecting a Page
```tsx
import { useAuth } from '@/contexts/AuthContext';

export default function ProtectedPage() {
  const { user, requireAuth } = useAuth();

  useEffect(() => {
    requireAuth(); // Redirects to login if not authenticated
  }, [requireAuth]);

  if (!user) return null; // Show loading while redirecting

  return <div>Protected content here</div>;
}
```

### Protecting an Action
```tsx
const handleProtectedAction = () => {
  if (!user) {
    requireAuth(); // Saves current page and redirects to login
    return;
  }
  
  // Proceed with action
  performAction();
};
```

## Migration Notes

- All existing `openLoginPopup()` calls should be replaced with `requireAuth()`
- The redirect system is backward compatible with existing authentication flow
- No changes needed to Supabase authentication configuration
- Works with all existing login methods (email/password, OTP, Google, Facebook)
